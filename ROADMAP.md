# Roadmap


* Add tests for... everything? (the goal is to cover at least the `User` + `Channel` + `Server` classes).
* Python3 test grid to test against different Python versions.
* Log more things more seriously (that helps so much for debugging).
* Changes channels and users properties and make them faster (dicts over lists).
* Take the [progress.md](progress.md) document and try to work on the missing commands.

**Note:** As much as we can, we'll try to strictly only rely on the Python3 standard library.
